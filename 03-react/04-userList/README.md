# userList
## Template: React + Vite

In this repository I have been practicing many things, so everything may seem very disorganized. Files ![UserList](https://github.com/angylearns/femcoders_fullstack/blob/main/03-react/04-userList/src/components/UserList.jsx), ![UserList2](https://github.com/angylearns/femcoders_fullstack/blob/main/03-react/04-userList/src/components/UserList2.jsx), ![UserList3](https://github.com/angylearns/femcoders_fullstack/blob/main/03-react/04-userList/src/components/UserList3.jsx) are three tasks in which the next one uses the previous one and returns another functionality.

Components UserList, UserList2 and UserLis3 are called and commented in ![UserListView](https://github.com/angylearns/femcoders_fullstack/blob/main/03-react/04-userList/src/components/UserListView.jsx) and, to use each one, they must be uncommented.
