# userList
## Template: React + Vite

In this repository I have been practicing many things, so everything may seem very disorganized. ![](https://github.com/angylearns/femcoders_fullstack/blob/main/03-react/04-userList/src/components/UserList.jsx) Files 1, 2, 3 are three tasks in which the next one uses the previous one and returns another functionality.

Components 1, 2, 3 are called and commented in UserListView and, to view each one, they must be uncommented.
